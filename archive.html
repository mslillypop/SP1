        <h3>Cosmology</h3>
        <p>01/02/23 - 04/04/23</p>
        <p class="p3">
          Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 'The Sky
          Above Us', explores the night sky and what we can see and know about
          the universe around us. We'll locate the various constellations and
          galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators
          who used the stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar
          exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo's telescope, to the
          latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

        <h3>Evolution</h3>
        <p>Permanent display</p>
        <p class="p3">
          For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
          question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
          here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
          framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
          Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
          know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet
          a few of the creatures who didn't survive, including our Woolly
          Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

        <h3>Robotics & AI</h3>
        <p>01/02/23 - 02/06/23</p>
        <p class="p3">
          The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
          intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
          applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here.
          You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

        <h3>Night in the Museum</h3>
        <p>25/02/23</p>
        <p class="p3">
          Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you
          sleep over beside dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your own
          sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we go exploring the wonders
          of science.

        <h3>Energetica Exhibition</h3>
        <p>On loan until 05/06/23</p>
        <p class="p3">
          On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
          exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It's a series of
          installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
          elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
          'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind
          to create power.

        <h3>Lectures in Aeronautics</h3>
        <p>27/02/23 - 01/03/23</p>
        <p class="p3">
          It is our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the
          Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be delivering 3 lectures on
          the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in this
          exciting 'space'.
