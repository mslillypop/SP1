Community Science Museum was the Student Project 1 that I did for the half way mark of my first year of Frontend Development. 

## Description

For this project I was tasked with making a website for a fictional Community Science Museum. The target audience were children and families. The site was to be informative and engaging and work seamlessly across multiple devices. 

The site had to contain 4-6 pages in the site architecture, I chose to do:

- Home
- About
- Visit
- Explore
- Whats on?

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS

### Where to find the deployed site?

You can find the link to the site itself below:
