          <h3>About us</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we're committed
            to making science accessible to all. Over the course of human
            history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire,
            wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far
            away to the very building blocks of life itself. The aim of our
            museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the
            wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong
            passion to continue the exploration of the world around us. We
            believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought
            to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different
            exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of
            these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around
            to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits - they
            only come to life at night when everyone's gone home).
          </p>

          <h3>Get involved</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>Support</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are
            very welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and
            accessible to the whole community. You can also support us by
            donating items of interest to the museum's collections. If you have
            some item or collection that you think others would enjoy, please
            let us know by contacting our Collections Department and they will
            be able to assist you.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Volunteer</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
            displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
            Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
            scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
            monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
            discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum. You
            can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact
            us if you'd like to find out more about how you can get involved.
          </p>
